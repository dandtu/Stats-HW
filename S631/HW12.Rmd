```{r}
library(alr4)
m1 = lm(formula = log(BSAAM)~log(APMAM)+log(APSAB)+log(APSLAKE)+log(OPBPC)+log(OPRC)+log(OPSLAKE),data=water)
rp1=residualPlots(m1,id.n=2)
```
Some of the residual plots seem to have curvature.\par

```{r}
rp1
```
None of the tests has small significance levels, provding no evidence against the mean function. With p-value of **0.066** in Tukey test, We do not have enough evidence to reject the H0 that there is no curvature.\par

```{r}
m2=lm(Buchanan~Bush,data=florida)
scatterplot(Buchanan~Bush,data= florida,id.n=1)
```
The Scatterplot shows **PALM BEACH** is an outlier.\par

```{r}
outlierTest(m2)
cd2=cooks.distance(m2)
cd2[50]
mean(cd2)
```
Based on the test, we obtained a very small p-value that is an indication that it is an outlier. From the cook test for the city **PALM BEACH**, compare with the mean of **cd2** we observed a high value, and we conclue that the city **PALM BEACH** has a very high chance it is an outlier.\par

```{r}
scatterplot(Buchanan~Bush,data= florida,id.n=2)
```
It seems another country with an unusal value of the Buchanan vote, given its **Bush** value, is **DADE**
```{r}
cd2[13]
mean(cd2)
```
Same as the previous one, the distance value of the city **DADE** is large, we conclude that the city **DADE** has the high chance to be an outlier. It seems the butterfly ballot do have the issue of vote.

```{r}
inverseResponsePlot(m2)
boxCox(m2)
```
From the graph we observe that the best lambda is about 0.3. And the boxCox shows that 0 is concluded under the 95% confidence interval. Therefore, we use **log** transformation to better fit a simple linear regression.
```{r}
m3=lm(Buchanan~log(Bush),data=florida)
scatterplot(Buchanan~log(Bush),data= florida,id.n=2)
```
```{r}
outlierTest(m3)
cd3=cooks.distance(m3)
cd3[50]
mean(cd3)
```
Based on the cook distance test, and compared with mean value, the city **PALM BEACH** is still have large distance value and we still conclude that it has a high chance to be an outlier.

```{r}
cd3[13]
mean(cd3)
```
Comparing with the prevous steps to test the city **DADE**, We found that the DADE now has the distance below the mean, and we conclude that after the transformation, the city **DADE** seems no longer to be an outlier.
